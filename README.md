# ðŸŽ“ Online Course Management System â€“ OOP Mini Project

This project is a simulation of an **Online Course Management System** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

It's designed as a mini-interview task to demonstrate skills in abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and class design for real-world systems.

---

## âœ… Objective

To design and implement a role-based system where:
- **Instructors** can create courses and assignments and grade student work.
- **Students** can enroll in courses and upload assignments.
- The system enforces **role-based access** and reflects real-world relationships using OOP.

---

## ðŸ§  UML Class Diagram

The UML diagram below was designed using PlantUML and shows the full structure of the system, including:

- Superclass `User`
- Subclasses `Student`, `Instructor`
- Associative classes: `Course`, `Assignment`, `Grade`
- Inheritance and association relationships
- Public/private access specifiers
- Method overriding (`getRole()`)

## ðŸ’» Code Overview (JavaScript)

The system is implemented in **JavaScript** using ES6 classes.

### ðŸ”§ Classes & Responsibilities:
| Class       | Responsibility                                   |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `User`      | Abstract base class with common fields & methods |
| `Student`   | Enroll in courses, upload assignments            |
| `Instructor`| Create courses, assignments, and grade students  |
| `Course`    | Holds students and assignments                   |
| `Assignment`| Tracks submissions and grades                    |
| `Grade`     | Stores scores and feedback                       |

### âœ¨ Key Features:
- Method overriding via `getRole()` (Polymorphism)
- Encapsulated fields using class methods
- Associations via arrays/maps (e.g., enrolledCourses, submissions)
- Dynamic ID generation for courses and assignments

## ðŸ§ª Demo Flow

```javascript
1. Instructor logs in and creates a course
2. Instructor adds an assignment to the course
3. Student logs in and enrolls in the course
4. Student submits the assignment
5. Instructor grades the assignment
